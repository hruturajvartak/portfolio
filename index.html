    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      A resume alone cannot capture the full breadth of my skills and experiences. This portfolio showcases selected mechanical design projects that reflect my technical expertise, problem-solving approach, and passion for innovation. To respect confidentiality agreements with previous employers, some projects are presented conceptually. Together, these examples illustrate my design methodology, technical skills, and ability to deliver measurable results.<br><br>
      Technology evolves rapidly, but the principles of design, rooted in an understanding of people, remain timeless. I hope you find these projects as engaging to explore as I did to create.
